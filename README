 To change the parameters of the ray tracer, use the two #define statements at the top of main.cpp
 
 #define LAYOUT_FILE
	Tells the ray tracer what layout file to load.
	Options are:
		"samples/redsphere.rtl" -> a single red sphere, loads quickly
		"samples/red_sphere_and_blue_sphere.rtl" -> two spheres, loads quickly and shows reflection capabilities
		"samples/red_sphere_and_teapot.rtl" -> loads very slowly, but will display eventually. Use to confirm the ability to display polygons.
		
#define RAY_DEPTH
	Tells the ray tracer how many recursive steps should be taken for each ray
	NOTE: This ray tracer is very slow. Increasing this number for a scene with polygons will cause BIG delays while rendering.
	Making this large in a scene with only spheres won't be nearly as slow.
	
Because the ray tracer is so slow, the console window will print out the current progress as a helpful guide.
